## Summary

You will need to deploy 2 logic apps:

Logic App 1: reads incoming email from an outlook mailbox and calls Logic App2

Logic App 2: Calls Azure OpenAI for answers to the user support question and emails back a response. 

### Note: 

We will deploy the 2nd logic app first because we need its URL when provisioning the first logic app.

## Step 1. Signin to Azure Portal

Go to https://portal.azure.com and enter your credentials

## Step 2. Deploy Logic App 2 (email-techsupport-integration)

### OpenAI Prompt Overview
This logic app uses the following prompt to answer questions sent to a technical support mail box:

_________________________________________________________________________
Extract the person name  and technical problems from the text below, look for possible solutions and write and email that includes posible solutions for software problems include links to websites, if no solutions are indicate we will get back to them. If this is a hardware problem give them tips for troubleshooting and indicate we will create a support ticket and schedule a repair within 48 hours.  Write links to websites in html code.

In this step you are going to perform the following actions to deploy and configure the logic app:

- Deploy the logic app that sends the user question to OpenAI
- Copy the URL for this Logic App for use in the second logic app
- Enter OpenAI authentication credentials
- Configure your connection to Outlook
